## Motivation

Unpresedented attack of the virus Covid-19 has hit worse on both small scale as well as large scale industries. Service providing companies got crushed down. And now when it is clear that the virus will have deepest possible impact on the world economy, many of the states will be interdependent for growth and support.
Corona outbroke in last week of december at Wuhan. 

this gave me an idea about creating a live support and stat showing application for normal peoples who are suffering from this massive outbreak.
